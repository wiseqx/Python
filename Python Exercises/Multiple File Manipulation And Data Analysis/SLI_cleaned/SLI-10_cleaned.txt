last week a boy and his dog were looking at this new pet frog that 
they'd got . 
they were well happy . 
the boy and the dog fell asleep . 
but the frog thought he'd jump out_of the jar and take a look 
around . 
next morning the boy and the dog realized that the frog had gone . 
they were devastated . 
they were looking everywhere for it , underneath the bed , in 
clothes , underneath the stool . 
the boy and the dog even shouted the name out_of the window . 
then all of a sudden something terrible happened . 
the dog fell out_of the window . 
the boy looked really upset . 
then the boy went downstairs . 
and the dog was alright . 
but the boy wasn't . 
they went out into the back garden in the woods . 
and they were calling for the frog 
where are you , where are you ? 
they were looking everywhere . 
they were calling for him . 
and then this little animal came out and said 
oy stop shouting where I live ! 
okay then . 
said the boy . 
and the dog was trying to jump up the tree . 
all of a sudden 0 [*] dog hit off the beehive . 
and they were buzzing around everywhere . 
and the boy looked in this hole of [*] the tree trunk . 
and this owl came out . 
he fell back down . 
and all the bees were chasing the dog . 
Dog was howling and going 
argh ! 
and then the owl followed the boy . 
and he was hiding 
go away , go away ! 
but that [//] it was alright now . 
(.) he just went off into the tree . 
and the boy was still calling for the frog . 
and all of a sudden a deer picked him up ! 
he'd disturbed the deer ! 
and then they were running . 
the deer was on the boy's head ! 
and the dog was barking at the deer . 
and they were near a mountain cliff . 
and he was nearly about to fall . 
and then the boy and the dog fell down [/] down into a pond . 
and the deer was pleased . 
they went right in and the dog was like 
wee ! 
and then they found them , the two frogs . 
one frog being their's@n . 
but he had another frog with him and that was his woman frog . 
and they were smiling . 
and then all the other little frogs came out . 
and they were really happy . 
so they took one of the little frogs . 
and they went 
bye , cheerio !

alright the little boy starts off in his room with a pet dog 
and he's got a frog in a glass tub . 
and he's like just looking at it and things . 
and then he goes into bed , the dog 0 [*] sleeping on the end . 
and the frog crawls out_of the jar and jumps out the window . 
in the morning , the guy looks at the tub . 
and he can't see the frog . 
he doesn't know where it is . 
so he starts getting dressed . 
and the dog's playing around with the thing , got his head stuck in 
the jar . 
and he's opened the window full up . 
and he's shouting trying to find [//] trying to get [//] see 
where he is . 
then the dog falls out the window . 
and the glass smashes . 
and he picks up the dog . 
and he's not looking very happy . 
he goes into the forest just around his house and into the trees . 
and 0 [*] starts shouting something to get its attention and see 
where it is . 
he looks down like a little badger's hole and 0 [*] like 
crawling down there to see if it's in . 
and the dog's seen a [/] a bees' hive . 
and he's barking at that and even more so . 
and then the badger jumps out . 
and he's like yuck or something like that . 
and then the [/] the wasps' thing falls down , smashes near the dog 
. 
and the kid's up in like a massive great [//] massive tree with 
like a little hole in it sort of like an owl's hole ? 
and then as that smashes , the bees have gone after the dog because 
he's breaked [*] the 0 [*] 
and the [/] a massive owl has come out . 
and the guy's fallen off the tree and fell on his back . 
and well the owl sort of screeched at him . 
and he's near a rock . 
and he's come up . 
and there's some bushes behind it and these massive like branch [*] 
. 
he thinks it's a branch . 
so he's standing up on there yelling , trying to see where it is . 
and then it is not twigs . 
it's a reindeer ! 
so then he's running off the cliff with his dog down the bottom . 
and then the reindeer stops [//] comes to halt . 
and he falls over into water [//] into like a little lake or 
puddle . 
and he finds a little broken off tree branch next_to him , with his 
dog on his head . 
so then he goes up to the branch on one side of it and tells the 
dog to be shh . 
right . 
0 [*] climbs over . 
and he finds the frogs , a little family . 
so it's like [//] he's happy . 
and the dog's like oh right . 
and then he gets his frog . 
and he's waving goodbye to the family . 
and that's the end .

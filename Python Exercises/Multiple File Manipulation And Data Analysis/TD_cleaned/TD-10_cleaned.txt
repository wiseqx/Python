last week my friend Billy , who's always been interested in animals 
, found a pet frog . 
he carried the frog everywhere with him all day until it was time 
to go to sleep . 
his pet dog Bowwow said good_night@q to the frog . 
and together they got into bed . 
during the night the frog hoped out_of the (.) jar and out_of the 
window . 
all while my friend Billy was sleeping . 
when Billy woke up the next morning he discovered that the frog was 
gone . 
Billy looked everywhere for it , in his mother's boots , in the jar 
, under the bed 
Mister frog where are you ? 
called Billy . 
Billy had no idea where to look . 
slowly him and Bowwow dropped down out_of the window . 
together they could do anything 
Mister frog where are you ? 
Billy searched into the forest . 
there was a beehive nearby . 
Billy tried to ignore it but Bowwow just couldn't . 
the bees were just far too interesting 
Mister frog where are you ? 
Billy called down a rabbit hole . 
a little rabbit came out 
oy this is my hole ! 
he said . 
Bowwow just couldn't take his eyes off that beehive . 
he had to go and see what was there . 
suddenly it fell down 
woof woof ! 
said Bowwow 
help me ! 
but Billy was far too interested in looking for Mister frog . 
he was trying to look in the tree . 
but suddenly an owl came out 
oh ! 
said Billy 
you gave me a shock ! 
Billy continued to look . 
he tried to look over the [/] the larger [*] boulder in the forest 
. 
but suddenly an antelope come out [//] came out ! 
it carried him off and carried him far , far away . 
until it came to a grassy knoll where it let go of Billy . 
and Billy fell splash into a pond ! 
Billy could hear the sounds of croaking 
maybe its Mister frog ? 
he said . 
he told Bowwow to be quiet and slowly peered behind the big log . 
and there was Mister frog with another frog [//] a lady frog . 
Billy crept down . 
there were lots_of little frogs too . 
Mister frog said he was very , very happy with Missus frog . 
and so they could give him one of their children instead . 
Billy settled with this and waved goodbye to Mister frog with one 
of the babies in the hand .

I found a frog . 
and I put it in a glass container . 
I had to go to sleep quite early that night , as I had to get 
up early in the morning . 
when I woke up I found that my frog had disappeared [//] got 
out somehow . 
I looked everywhere [/] everywhere . 
and my dog even helped me . 
my dog put his head in the container and got it stuck . 
I went to the window and started making noises out the window to 
see if my frog would appear . 
the dog jumped out the window and broke the glass container that 
was stuck on his neck . 
I jumped out after him . 
I was quite angry . 
we went down to the bottom of the field by my garden and started 
calling . 
but I still couldn't find him . 
we looked in a badger's hole . 
and my dog looked up a tree where there was a wasps' hive . 
he knocked it down . 
but I didn't see him do this . 
I just saw the bees after him . 
and I climbed the tree . 
the bees chased my dog . 
I went over by a rock . 
and there was an owl that tried to attack me . 
I climbed up and started calling out for him . 
but there was a deer . 
and he scooped me on to his .

he came to the edge of the cliff . 
and he threw me off . 
and I fell off him and landed in some water [//] a pond . 
and I thought that the frog might be here . 
I heard something . 
and I crept over to the log . 
and I peered over it . 
and I saw my frog with his girlfriend and his little baby frogs . 
. 
Child whispers to the INV I think I said that wrong actually

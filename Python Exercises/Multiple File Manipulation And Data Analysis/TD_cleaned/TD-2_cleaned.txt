I like this story . 
an owl came out_of the tree . 
and the little boy fell over back down to the ground . 
and all the bees out_of the bees' nest started chasing the dog 
who's running away very very quickly . 
the owl starts flying off .

the dog's gone with the bees somewhere . 
the owl perched up a tree in the top left+hand corner . 
and the boy climbs up the rock to where what appears to be two big 
twigs or a tree . 
and the dog comes back . 
suddenly the two big trees lift up and it's actually a stag with 
antlers . 
and the boy is completely on his head .

but suddenly the dog is on the boys head . 
and he listens for this sound .

he thinks the frog might be in there . 
(.) the dog is [//] you can only see his tail and head , 
because he's swimming . 
and the boy is signaling for him to be quiet . 
they look over the other side of the log both of them . 
and on the other side of the log they can see two big frogs sitting 
there . 
what looks like a mother and a dad whatever . 
they both the dog and the boy sit on the log . 
and look there's lots_of little froglets@c just next_to them [//] 
next_to the two big frogs . 
he picks up his frog and starts wading back across the pond . 
and all of the frogs and froglets@c apart from one sit up on top of 
the log and like say 
goodbye .

there was a little boy and his dog and they were sat in his 
bed+room . 
and it was at last night . 
and they he had a little pet frog , which he kept in a jar . 
and then he went to bed . 
and the frog managed to escape . 
but when the boy woke up in the morning he found that the frog had 
gone . 
he looked in the shoes . 
and his dog helped him look in there [//] in the jar where the 
frog had been . 
but they couldn't find him anywhere . 
they looked out the window . 
and the dog had managed to get the jar stuck on his head . 
and then he fell out . 
and the boy looked a bit worried . 
he went to pick up the dog . 
and the jar had smashed on the ground . 
then they went outside to continue looking . 
the little boy shouted for him . 
and the dog got intrigued with the bees , which he followed the 
trail of them . 
the little boy looked down a hole to see if the frog was there . 
and the dog barked up at the bees . 
a little mole came out_of the hole , much to the boy's surprise 
. 
and the boy [//] the dog continued to bark at the bees . 
then the bees came out_of the hive . 
and the little boy looked in the tree . 
then the little boy fell out_of the tree , when the owl came out . 
and the dog got chased by the bees . 
then the little boy , looking very cross now , climbed up a big 
pile of rocks to see if the frog was there . 
he shouted on the top . 
but he couldn't see him . 
and then he ended up on a deer's head . 
and the deer ran away with him . 
and the little dog chased . 
and they came to the edge of the cliff . 
then the deer pushed the boy and the little dog over . 
and they fell off the cliff . 
and they ended up in a pond , with the dog on his head . 
then they [//] the little boy said 
shh . 
to the little dog . 
and they climbed over a log . 
and on the other side they found the frog and his mate and a 
little herd [//] a little group of baby frogs . 
the boy now looked happy . 
and he took the little frog home with him .

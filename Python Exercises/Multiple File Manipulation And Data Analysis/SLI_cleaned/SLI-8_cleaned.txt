(.) yesterday there was a boy called Tom . 
and he had a dog called Sam . 
they had a pet frog called Bob . 
and Tom was very tired . 
so he went to bed . 
and while Tom was asleep Bob the frog escaped from his pot . 
next morning Tom woke up with this frog not [//] this dog Sam 
beside him too (.) . 
and they notice that Bob has gone . 
so Tom put on his clothes and went to go and find him . 
they looked out the window and started calling for him . 
then they went outside to look a bit further . 
and they went all the way around into the woods and round that area 
. 
and they started calling his name over and over . 
they looked down holes . 
they looked at beehives . 
when Tom looked down a hole , he found that a weasel came out 
and bit his nose . 
Sam was playing around by a tree . 
and he noticed a beehive . 
and Tom was looking in a hole in the tree . 
so Sam set the bees off . 
and they went mad starting to chase Sam . 
so Tom blew [//] laid down quiet and still . 
and there was an owl above them making loud noises . 
the owl was still above Tom , when he climbed on to a big rock [//] 
snow rock thing . 
he climbed up to the top shouting with Sam below . 
Tom realized it was a moose . 
the moose carried Tom away . 
and Sam started following them to the side of a hill . 
when the moose threw Tom and Sam off the side of the hill , they 
land [//] both landed in a massive pond . 
they both got soaking wet . 
shh ! 
Tom said 
be quiet . 
because they heard a noise coming from a log . 
Tom and Sam looked through a hole [//] looked around the other 
side . 
they saw Bob with a female frog . 
and they had a family . 
so they left them they said 
goodbye . 
and went off back to the house .

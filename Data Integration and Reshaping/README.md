# Data Integration and Reshaping

This Python file focuses on data integration and reshaping. I am going to integrate data
 collected from different sources and then solve different levels of conflicts.
 The output of this file is an integrated dataset and a Jupyter Notebook containing information
 about designed global schema. All the Python scripts are used in integrating the data.

## The datasets are:
* S1(data_s1_ass3.csv): contains 4600 records
* S2(data_s1_ass3.xml): contains 430 records

For more details, please view the file "Data Integration and Reshaping.ipynb".

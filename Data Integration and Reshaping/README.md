This Python file focuses on data integration and reshaping. I am going to integrate data
 that collected from different sources and solve different levels of conflicts in integration.
 The output of this file is an integrated dataset and a Jupyter Notebook containing information
 about designed global schema and all the Python scripts used in integrating the data.

The datasets are:
* S1(data_s1_ass3.csv): contains 4600 records
* S2(data_s1_ass3.xml): contains 430 records

last week the boy was saying good_night@q to his frog who 
lived in a jar . 
and when he went to sleep one night , somehow the frog escaped from 
the jar while he was sleeping . 
when the boy woke up he noticed that the frog had disappeared . 
so he and his dog started searching for it around his room and 
outside his house . 
unfortunately for his dog , he fell out_of the window and had the 
jar around his face . 
and as he fell out he he [/] he landed on the ground 
smashing the jar . 
when the boy came out , he wasn't actually pleased with his dog 
. 
they left the house and started to search for the frog around 
in the forest . 
they started calling for him . 
while the boy was looking for the frog , his silly dog was 
barking at a beehive which had many bees [/] bees flying around 
. 
the boy didn't find the smell of a rat very pleasing . 
(.) after shaking the tree , the dog managed to bring down the 
beehive to the ground , which didn't make the bees very happy . 
while the boy was searching for his frog in [/] in a tree 
and the [//] the tree had a hole so he looked in it , as he did 
an owl flew right in front of him . 
and so he fell off while the dog was being chased by the bees . 
he managed to get away from the bees and the owl . 
and so they carried on looking for his frog . 
he climbed onto a rock . 
and then somehow managed to get on top of a deer's heads [*] and 
was quite scared because the deer was running off some low sort 
of cliff . 
the boy managed to get off the head but accidentally fell down 
straight into a pond with his dog as well . 
the dog fell into a pond . 
but then after they got up they heard a sound . 
and it sounded like a frog . 
and it was coming from a tree+trunk . 
he told his dog to shush . 
and a couple of seconds later he looked over and saw two frogs and 
their children (.) and his frog . 
as he found his frog he waved goodbye to the other frogs and took 
his frog home .

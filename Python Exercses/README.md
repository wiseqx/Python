# Python Data Types and Built-in Methods

## 1. Brief & Synopsis
In this practice, I will get to work on various programming constructs of Python, such as
python built-in data types and the methods associated with each of these data types,
program control structures, and the standard input and output. 

## 2. Instructions
This practice will assessed on applying various built-in data types as well as 
utilising the associated methods for the implementation of Python programs that perform
basic processing on texts.

* String data type and its built-in methods
* List data type and its built-in methods
* Tuple data type and its built-in methods
* Dictionary data type and its built-in methods
* Standard input and output
* Selective and iterative control structures

## 3. What are python files about?

### Python_file 1 :Standard Input and Output
Python_file 1 is a basic Python program that will repeatedly prompts the user to input a number
of lines of text. The input process is considered complete whenever the program has 
encountered or detected a total of 5 sentence delimiters, which can either be a full stop
 or period ".", a question mark "?", or an exclamation mark "!".
 
### Python_file 2: Basic Processing of Texts
Python_file2 is going to explore different Python built-in data types, in particular 
the sequences, to organize the input texts from Python file 1. The program is to perform some 
basic processing on the input texts

Extending from the program implemented in Python file 1, the input text are segmented
into individual sentences. The end of each sentence should be denoted by either a full stop
 or period ".", a question mark "?", or an exclamation mark "!". The program tokenises each sentence
 into individual works, where words within a sentence are separated by spaces " ". Any punctuation marks
 such as a comma "," and a semicolon ";" that appear within a sentence should be considered as individal 
 tokens. (Note that the apostrophe "’" should be considered as part of the word that it is attached to.)
 
 The number of tokens or words should be 46 with 41 words and 5 punctuation marks(4 ","s and 1 ".")
 
 The program considers which of the sequence data types in Python is best for organising 
 the segmented sentences and the individual words associated with each sentence for 
 further processing. In particular, it considers how to retrieve a particular sentence or particular
 word from a sentence.

 ### Python_file 3: Basic Analysis of Texts
 Python_file3 is an extension of the program from Python_file2. Upon segmenting the input 
 text (or the paragraph) into sentences and words, the program is extended to perform 
 some simple analysis on the input text.
 
 Python_file3 perform the following analysis:
 * Count the total number of words and the total number of characters
 * Count the total number of unique words (ignoring the case of letters)
 * Count the number of words that begin with an uppercasee letter (ie.A-Z)
 * Count the number of different punctuation marks
 * Count the number of words that are numbers (ie. Words that consist of digits 0-9)
 
 At the end of program, all the counts on the terminal screen are displayed in an informative 
 way.
 
 ## How to run?
### 1.Running Python using Jupyter Notebook:

Task 1:

In order to test assignment_task1, you now start entering the Python code: “%run assignment_task1” in the first line. To execute this single line of Python code, press “shift” and “enter” in your keyboard or just click on the “run” button:
